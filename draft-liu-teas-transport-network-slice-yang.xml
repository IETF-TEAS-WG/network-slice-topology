<t>An IETF network slice may use a customized topology to describe intended
   resource reservation for connectivities between slice endpoints. Customized
   topologies enable customers to request shared resources among connections activated
   on demand and to customize the service paths in a network slice with 
   an extensive level of control.</t>

<t>This document describes a YANG data model for managing and
   controlling customized topologies for IETF network slices defined in
   RFC YYYY.</t>

<section anchor="introduction"><name>Introduction</name>

<t><xref target="I-D.ietf-teas-ietf-network-slices"/> describes that an IETF network
   slice service customer might ask for some level of control, e.g., 
   to customize the service paths while requesting network slice services.
   These customized controls may well be expressed by customer-defined 
   topologies, i.e. customized topologies.</t>

<t>Furthermore, by using customized topologies, customers can request advanced
   resource reservation for all potential network slices that can be activated 
   on demand in the future. This capability provides customers with full control
   over when and how resources are allocated by the slices. The resources can be
   shared by network slices created at different times as well as by connections
   between different edge pairs within the same network slice. This could significantly
   reduce the overall bandwidth requirements of a network slice and provide economic
   advantages to the customer.</t>

<t>For example, in a hub-and-spoke network slice scenario, multiple customer’s 
   spoke sites are expected to be dynamically connected to the hub site and the 
   bandwidth is shared between the spoke sites. To create a customized topology with 
   two virtual nodes, one representing all the spoke sites and the other representing 
   the hub site, connected by a shared link between the two, can ensure that resources 
   for the shared connection are reserved in advance and hence are readily 
   available whenever needed by the customer. On the other hand, to achieve the same level
   of bandwidth assurance with connections, it would be necessary to create separate, 
   dedicated connections between every spoke and the hub. However, this would result 
   in significant waste of bandwidth.</t>

<t>This document defines a YANG <xref target="RFC7950"/> data model for representing,
   managing, and controlling IETF network slices over customized
   network topologies, where the network slices are defined
   in <xref target="I-D.ietf-teas-ietf-network-slices"/>. The YANG model augments
   the data model defined in <xref target="RFC8345"/> to enable a customer to 
   express desired service-level objectives (SLOs) and service-level expectations (SLEs)
   over various constructs within the customized topology.</t>

<t>The defined data model is an interface between customers and
   providers for configurations and state retrievals, so as to support
   network slicing as a service.  Through this model, a customer can request or 
   negotiate with a network slicing provider to create an instance.<br />
   The customer can incrementally update its requirements on individual 
   topology elements in the slice instance, e.g., adding or removing a node or 
   link, updating desired bandwidth of a link, and retrieve the operational states
   of these elements. With the help of other mechanisms and data models defined 
   in IETF, the telemetry information can be published to the customer, too.</t>

<t>The YANG model defines constructs that are technology-agnostic to network slicing
   built on network layers with different technologies such as IP/MPLS, MPLS-TP, 
   OTN and WDM optical. Therefore, this model can serve as a common and base model
   on which technology-specific models for network slicing, such as 
   <xref target="I-D.ietf-ccamp-yang-otn-slicing"/>, may be built.</t>

<t>As described in Section 3 of
   <xref target="I-D.contreras-teas-slice-controller-models"/>, using customized topologies and 
   control of resource reservation is optional for network slicing and complements
   the data model defined in <xref target="I-D.ietf-teas-ietf-network-slice-nbi-yang"/>.</t>

<t>The YANG data model in this document conforms to the Network
   Management Datastore Architecture (NMDA) <xref target="RFC8342"/>.</t>

<section anchor="model-applicability"><name>Model Applicability</name>

<t>There are many technologies to achieve network slicing.  The data
   model defined in this document can be used to configure resource-based
   network slices, where the resources for network slices are reserved
   and represented in the form of a customized topology, which can then be mapped
   to a network resource partition (NRP) according to the scenarios defined
   in <xref target="I-D.ietf-teas-ietf-network-slices"/>.</t>

<t>Network slices may be abstracted differently depending on the requirement of 
   the network slice customer. A customer may request a network slice with
   direct connectivity between pairs of service demarcation points (SDPs).
   Each connection within the network slice may be further supported by an 
   end-to-end tunnel that traverse a specific path in a given customized topology
   supplied by the customer. The resources associated with a link are immediately
   commissioned by the realization at the time of network slice configuration.</t>

<t>Alternatively, a customer can request resources to be reserved for
   potential network slices through a customized topology, and use the resources
   to build network slices in the future. The customized topology represents resources that
   are reserved but not commissioned at the time of request. By doing so, customers can share 
   resources between multiple endpoints and use them on demand.</t>

<t>In the example shown in <xref target="fig-ns-topo-example"/>, two customized topology intents named as
   Network Slice Blue and Network Slice Red, are created
   by separate customers and delivered to the network slice service provider.
   The provider maps the two intents to corresponding network resource partitions (NRPs)
   internally. In realizing the network resource partitions, node virtualization
   is used to separate and allocate resources in physical devices.  Two virtual
   routers VR1 and VR2 are created over physical router R1, and two virtual
   routers VR3 and VR4 are created over physical router R2, respectively.  Each of the
   virtual routers,as a partition of the physical router, takes a portion 
   of the resources such as ports and memory in the physical router.<br />
   Depending on the requirements and the implementations, they may share 
   certain resources such as processors, ASICs, and switch fabric.</t>

<t>A network slice customer can configure customized topologies without any prior knowledge
   of the provider’s network and resource availability. However, this could potentially make 
   it difficult for the provider to understand and realize the topology. Alternatively, the 
   provider may choose to describe the available resources and capabilities as an abstract 
   topology and expose it to the customer prior to network slice requests. This can facilitate 
   the customer with building customized topologies and avoid unnecessary negotiations between 
   the customer and provider.</t>

<t>The process and the data models for the provider to expose abstract topologies are outside
   the scope of this document.</t>

<t>The provider reports the operational state of the topology, which represents the allocated
   resources agreed upon through negotiations between the customer and the provider.
   Customers can subquently process the requested topology and integrate it into their own topology.
   It's important to note that this relationship between the customer and provider can be recursive.
   For example, a customer for network slices can be a provider of its own to offer
   network slice services using customized topologies to its own customers further up
   the hierarchy.</t>

<t>As an example, Appendix B. shows the JSON encoded data instances of
   the customer topology intent for Network Slice Blue.</t>

<t>To ensure the security and controllability of physical resource
   isolation, slice-based independent operation and management are
   required to achieve management isolation.
   Each network slice typically requires dedicated accounts,
   permissions, and resources for independent access and O&amp;M. This
   mechanism is to guarantee the information isolation among slice
   tenants and to avoid resource conflicts. The access to slice
   management functions will only be permitted after successful security
   checks.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="security-considerations"><name>Security Considerations</name>

<t>The YANG module specified in this document defines a schema for data
   that is designed to be accessed via network management protocols such
   as NETCONF <xref target="RFC6241"/> or RESTCONF <xref target="RFC8040"/>.  The lowest NETCONF layer
   is the secure transport layer, and the mandatory-to-implement secure
   transport is Secure Shell (SSH) <xref target="RFC6242"/>.  The lowest RESTCONF layer
   is HTTPS, and the mandatory-to-implement secure transport is TLS
   <xref target="RFC8446"/>.</t>

<t>The NETCONF access control model <xref target="RFC8341"/> provides the means to
   restrict access for particular NETCONF or RESTCONF users to a
   preconfigured subset of all available NETCONF or RESTCONF protocol
   operations and content.</t>

<t>There are a number of data nodes defined in this YANG module that are
   writable/creatable/deletable (i.e., config true, which is the
   default).  These data nodes may be considered sensitive or vulnerable
   in some network environments.  Write operations (e.g., edit-config)
   to these data nodes without proper protection can have a negative
   effect on network operations.  Considerations in Section 8 of
   <xref target="RFC8795"/> are also applicable to their subtrees in the module defined
   in this document.</t>

<t>Some of the readable data nodes in this YANG module may be considered
   sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus
   important to control read access (e.g., via get, get-config, or
   notification) to these data nodes.  Considerations in Section 8 of
   <xref target="RFC8795"/> are also applicable to their subtrees in the module defined
   in this document.</t>

      <abstract>
	 <t>   The requirement of slicing network resources with desired quality of
   service is emerging at every network technology, including the
   Optical Transport Networks (OTN).  As a part of the transport
   network, OTN can provide hard pipes with guaranteed data isolation
   and deterministic low latency, which are highly demanded in the
   Service Level Agreement (SLA).

   This document describes a framework for OTN network slicing and
   defines YANG data models with OTN technology-specific augments
   deployed at both the north and south bound of the OTN network slice
   controller.  Additional YANG data model augmentations will be defined
   in a future version of this draft.

	 <t>   This document describes a potential division in major functional
   components of an IETF Network Slice Controller (NSC) as well as
   references the data models required for supporting the requests of
   IETF network slice services and their realization.

   This document describes a potential way of structuring the IETF
   Network Slice Controller as well as how to use different data models
   being defined for IETF Network Slice Service provision (and how they
   are related).  It is not the purpose of this document to standardize
   or constrain the implementation the IETF Network Slice Controller.
